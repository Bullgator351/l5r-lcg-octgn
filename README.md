# l5r-lcg-octgn
OCTGN plugin for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game

## Installation

Currently there isn't a feed with this game, manual installation using the local feed is required. Pre-built versions can be found under [releases](https://github.com/blakewedwards/l5r-lcg-octgn/releases) or in the [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By_ODAjR2bBEX1RZZjM0UEdHQVE). It's recommended to use the pre-built versions due to how OCTGN manages the updates for a game when a new version is found in a feed.

1. Download the latest game package (Legend of the Five Rings LCG-\*.\*.\*.\*.nupkg) from one of the sources above
1. Copy/move the downloaded game package to your OCTGN local feed directory (typically "C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\Documents\OCTGN\LocalFeed")
1. (Re)start OCTGN
1. Select the **Games Manager** tab
1. Select **Local (Developers)** from the dropdown in the top left of the tab
1. Select **Legent of the Five Rings LCG** from the list and click the **Install** button
1. You can optionally add an image pack by selecting **Add Image Packs** (a few buttons right of the feed dropdown) and navigating to the image pack you've made/obtained
1. The game should now be installed and availabe in the deck editor or when starting a new game

## Updating

If a new version has been released since you first installed the game, obtain the latest version as per **Installation** and copy/move it to the local feeds directory. When starting OCTGN, it should automatically detect and update to the latest version.
